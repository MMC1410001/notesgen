# Uploading these notes to Google Docs

1. Open <https://drive.google.com> and create a folder for the course.
2. Drag every `.docx` file in this folder into it.
3. Double-click a file, then **File > Save as Google Docs** (or right-click >
   *Open with* > *Google Docs*). The heading hierarchy becomes the outline
   pane: **View > Show outline**.

Read `00 - Course Index.docx` first; it links the sections together.

Files marked with `[!]` inside the notes flag places where the lecture's
audio did not cover what was on screen, or where captions were missing
entirely. Those gaps are deliberate - nothing there was inferred.

Prefer to paste rather than upload? See `../html/` - open one in a browser,
select all, copy, and paste straight into Word or Google Docs.
